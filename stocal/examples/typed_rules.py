"""An example of how to use typed rules

We model polymers made up of two types of monomers, with the contraint
that polymerization can only occurr among differently typed monomers.
We model this with a type system where the type of a polymer expresses
its leftmost and rightmost monomer types. E.g. a polymer starting with
A and ending in B has the type AB. (Monomers are therefor polymers of
type AA or BB.)

This example stretches a bit the boundaries of what can be done in a 
type system.
